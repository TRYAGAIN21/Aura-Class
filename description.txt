The Aura Class is a new class that has the speciality of... crowd control!

This mod currently has 2 subclasses: Auras and Waves.

Auras will create a ring and damage enemies inside the ring and cannot knockback enemies...
While Waves are controlled Auras that only partially cover an area, but deal more damage and can knockback enemies.

It may or may not add Decay Rate.
Decay Rate is for Auras and make the Aura deal less damage to enemies farther away from the center.

Credit to Beancicle II for the idea, NoHaxJustXmod for expanding it, and TRYAGAIN211 for turning this idea into reality.
