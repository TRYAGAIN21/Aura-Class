The Aura Class is a new class that has the speciality of... crowd control!

This mod currently has 2 subclasses: Auras and Waves.

Auras will create a ring and damage enemies inside the ring and cannot knockback enemies...
While Waves are controlled Auras that only partially cover an area, but deal more damage and can knockback enemies.
Note: No waves are currently in the mod.

Another feature is decay rate and is for Auras and make the Aura deal less damage to enemies farther away from the center.

Credit to Beancicle II for the idea, NoHaxJustXmod for expanding it, and TRYAGAIN211 for turning this idea into reality.
Also thanks for Glitchz123 for adding the idea of an aura, Black Magic, somehow I love testing things with it!
